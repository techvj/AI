README: Learn AI, GenAI, and Agent AI with Open Source Models
Welcome! If you're serious about learning Artificial Intelligence (AI), Generative AI (GenAI), and Agent-based AI, but you don't want to spend money on proprietary LLMs (Large Language Models), you're in the right place. You can still continue your learning journey by leveraging the power of open-source models and running them locally.

Why Open Source?
Open-source models give you the freedom to:

Learn and Experiment: With open models, you can explore and learn at your own pace without worrying about costs.
Customize: Modify and adapt the models according to your needs and use cases.
Contribute to the Community: Open-source projects are collaborative. You can contribute your insights, improvements, and bug fixes.
Maintain Privacy: Running models locally ensures your data stays private.

What You Will Learn
This guide will walk you through the basics of AI, GenAI, and Agent-based AI with open-source tools. By the end of your learning journey, you'll have:

A strong understanding of how AI models work.
The ability to build and run your own models locally.
Insights into generative models and how they create new content.
An understanding of agents in AI and how they can be used for decision-making and automation.
